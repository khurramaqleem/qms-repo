# Development Standards & Guidlines
# Introduction

This document outlines the standards, conventions, and best practices to be followed during the development of the Quality Management System (QMS). The objective is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and efficiency throughout the development lifecycle.

# Project Modules
The QMS will consist of the following core modules:

Document Control (DC)
Change Control (CO)
Training Management (TM)
Complaints Management (CM)
Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)
Non-Conformance (NCR)
Administration (ADM)

# Database Structure
3.1 Table Naming Convention

All tables will follow the naming convention: tbl_dc_tablename
tbl: Indicates a table.
dc: Represents the domain or module (DC for Document Control, TM for Training Management, etc.).
tablename: The actual name of the table in singular form.
3.2 Field Naming Convention

All fields will follow the naming convention: tbl_dc_tablename_fieldname
Fields should be in lowercase with underscores as separators.
Field names should be descriptive and meaningful.
3.3 Relationships and ERDs

Every new set of tables for a new functionality should have an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) defined.
The ERD filename should follow the convention: ERD_dc_functionality_description.
Foreign keys should be explicitly defined for relationships between tables.
Coding Standards
4.1 General Coding Practices

Adhere to a consistent coding style (PSR-12).
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Indent code consistently (4 spaces).
Add comments to explain function, complex logic, and non-obvious code sections.
Implement proper error handling and exception handling.
Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
4.2 File Header Comments

Every code file should start with a comment block containing:
Created By: Developer's name
Created On: Date
Purpose: Brief description of the file's purpose
4.3 Code Modification Comments

Any changes made to the code should be accompanied by a comment:
Edited By: Developer's name
Edited On: Date
Purpose: Reason for the change
Database Interaction
Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Optimize database queries for performance.
Version Control
Use version control system (e.g., Git) to track code changes.
Maintain a clear commit history with descriptive messages.
Testing and Debugging
Write unit tests for individual components.
Conduct integration testing to verify system functionality.
Documentation
Maintain up-to-date documentation for the system, including technical documentation, and API references.
Code Review
Regular code reviews will be conducted to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
By following these guidelines, the development team can create a high-quality, maintainable, and secure QMS.
